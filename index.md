**Galaxy-P platform for multi-omics!**

#### ***Not just for genomics anymore: Galaxy for multi-omics analysis!!!*** 
_Did you think that Galaxy is just for genomic data analysis? Not anymore. Come to this workshop to learn how Galaxy can be used for Mutli-omic data analysis (proteogenomic and metaproteomic) and also applications that cross the ‘omic domains. This hands-on workshop will guide participants through the essential steps for using Galaxy for the analysis of MS-based proteomics data, focusing on protein identification and more advanced multi-omic applications. Workflows from emerging applications integrating genomic and proteomic data (such as proteogenomics and metaproteomics) will also be demonstrated._

_In order to extend the reach of these workflows to the greater community, the Galaxy-P team has partnered with both the [JetStream cyberinfrastructure resource](http://jetstream-cloud.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com){:target="_blank"}_.  

**Target Audience**: _Core directors, personnel, data scientists and researchers interested in proteomics, multi-omics and microbiome research. Previous experience with Galaxy or other informatics solutions is not necessary_.


**_Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop computer to participate._**
<br>

**Workshop goals:**

_1. Introduce the Galaxy framework as a solution for data analysis across ‘omics’ domains._

_2. Provide hands-on experience to attendees in using Galaxy._

_3. Demonstrate use of Galaxy for a proteogenomic and metaproteomics analysis._

_4. Lay the foundation for attendees to implement Galaxy at their own facility or institution to meet ‘omics’ data analysis needs (either specific to one domain or for multi-omics)._
